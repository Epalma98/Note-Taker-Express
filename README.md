## Description
Given starter code, I was tasked with finshing an app that saved user inputted notes and have them post on the side of the page.

## Installation
To install the repo, clone it from Github.

## Usage
Load up the website from the link below. You'll be taken to the landing page that has a button saying "Get started". After clicking the button, you'll be taken to the actual note taking page. You can enter the Title of the note and the text of the note. By clicking the save button on the top right of the page, it'll post the note on the side of the page. From there, you can pull it up again or delete it from the list.
